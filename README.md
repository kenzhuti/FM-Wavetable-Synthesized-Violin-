## Abstract
As a matter of fact, the digital representation of musical instru-ments has long been a challenge for researchers, with the violin being one of the most complex due to its expressive nature and intricate timbre. This study delves into the synthesis of a digital violin, aiming to reproduce its rich sound by incorporating natural vibrato and bow pressure based on per-formance statistics. Utilizing wavetable and FM synthesis techniques, the research has been able to enhance the fixed spectrum of the violin to yield a more authentic sonic experience. Vibrato and bow pressure elements, once missing in many synthesizers, have been introduced to bring about greater expressiveness to the synthesized sound. The results of our research indi-cate a marked improvement in the naturalness and expressiveness of the digital violin, although achieving full realism remains a challenge. The ad-vancements made in this study significantly contribute to the field of digi-tal music synthesis, bridging the gap between traditional instruments and their digital counterparts.
